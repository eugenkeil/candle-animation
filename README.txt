This is Javascript candle animation that I wrote in 2014, 
when I was playing around with creating graphics on the canvas element
by using finite automata.

Demo here: http://www.ekeil.de/program/animations/animations.html

I might at some point add explanations as to how the code works, but
for now, please enjoy the candlelight.

There are still a lot of things one could improve, obviously.
- Making the colors more realistic
- making the background transparent, in order to be able to put the candle
  on non-black backgrounds.
- add explicit paramater control
